# Pick-a-Animal
Create 2 files, an html file, and a JS file that on load of the HTML file, dynamically creates a div, inside that div a select box with 10 values. 1-10 that display types of animals. When the user selects a value, it should print out to the right of the select box a description of that animal. The expectations are that the animals is a javascript object and the select box represents an array of Animals.
